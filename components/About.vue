    <h2>About/Disclaimer</h2>

      <p>This website is a private, non-official project - and by no means a complete neither a legal reflection of EU Directive 2019/882. I, a web developer living in Europe interested in web accessibility, tried to wrap my head around this directive.</p>

      <p><a href="https://directive2102.eu">If you are looking for information for Directive 2016/2102, often known as "EU Web Accessibility Directive", please click here.</a></p>

      <p>Since this project is <a href="https://github.com/marcus-herrmann/a11y-act.eu">open source and on GitHub</a> feel free to join and correct formulations if necessary.</p>
