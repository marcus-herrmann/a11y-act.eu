      <h2>What is the European Accessibility Act?</h2>

      <ul class="text-list">
        <li class="text-list">The complete title is Directive (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on the <strong>accessibility requirements for products and services</strong>.</li>
        <li>Compared with other parts of the world, <strong>accessibility of Europe's private sector</strong> (which means: companies) is not yet regulated. Directive 2019/882 is a first big step to change that.</li>
        <li>If you look at the EAA from a bird's eye view, it standardises regulations on the accessibility of products and services, and forces providers to <strong>develop and provide their services and products with <a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/">Inclusive Design in mind</a>.</strong></li>
        <li>However, unlike the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GPDR</abbr> for example, it is a directive, not a regulation. Quote, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)">Wikipedia</a>:

          <blockquote>A directive is a legal act of the European Union which requires member states to achieve a
            particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. It can be distinguished from
            regulations, which
            are self-executing and do not require any implementing measures.
          </blockquote>

          Meaning: a directive does not automatically becomes law in all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states, but binds the states to adopt
          its content into national law. These national laws are the jurisdictions that ultimately count. Yet the directive sets the direction.</li>
        <li>This also means that more regulatory details and recommendations for action for subjects of the private sector will emerge as soon as the national jurisdictions are in place. Nevertheless, it is a good moment to start considering accessibility <em>right now</em>.</li>
        <li>Critics complain that the EAA's focus is too much on the digital world - and is not the big shot it could be. Still, not least because of its impact on the European Union as a whole, it is a great step forward.</li>
